you can start by checking out the http://golang.org website

[10:57] 
because all the kool kids are using Go for server programming :simple_smile:

[10:58] 
There are some great introductory videos on that site -- and you can also google for videos by Rob Pike, Andrew Gerrand or Brad Fitzpatrick

Dennis Thisner [10:58 AM] 
awesome! I want to be cool too :viking01:

Colin Fox [10:58 AM] 
:smile:

[10:58] 
The cool thing about the golang website is that it actually has an interactive go programming system built into it as a step-by-step introduction

[10:58] 
so you can edit code in the webz and see it run :simple_smile:

Dennis Thisner [10:58 AM] 
sweet! I will start digging into that after I found all faulty stuff in Disney :simple_smile:

Colin Fox [10:58 AM] 
Cool

Dennis Thisner [10:59 AM] 
that is really neat and they got a hamster thingi as their mascot

Colin Fox [10:59 AM] 
The other tech that's big for back ends is Docker

[10:59] 
Hey, it's a gopher!

Dennis Thisner [10:59 AM] 
can’t go wrong with hamsters...

Colin Fox [10:59 AM] 
Don't dis the gopher man :simple_smile:

Dennis Thisner [10:59 AM] 
whatever… he is gomster :simple_smile:

[11:00] 
docker, think Max mention something about docker. Will look into that, is it better to look into docker after getting familiar with Go or do both at the same time, like a threesome

Colin Fox [11:00 AM] 
docker first

[11:00] 
I mean go first

[11:01] 
Though they are orthogonal

Dennis Thisner [11:02 AM] 
sounds very much like an apple meets a banana

Colin Fox [11:04 AM] 
I...guess? :simple_smile: Anyway, start with the golang website :simple_smile:

Dennis Thisner [11:05 AM] 
I will do, thank you :simple_smile:

[11:07] 
and better coding in Mac OS or Linux env?

Colin Fox [11:08 AM] 
I prefer linux, but that's really a preference thing. I use mac at home.

[11:09] 
My favourite text editor is Vim, but if you are unfamiliar with it, then it's a bit of a big bite to chew, so I would recommend Atom

[11:09] 
and Atom has Golang plugins to help formatting etc

[11:09] 
or Sublime

[11:09] 
either one is fine

[11:09] 
and they both have golang plugins

Dennis Thisner [11:09 AM] 
awesome! thank you :simple_smile:

Colin Fox [11:09 AM] 
np :simple_smile:
